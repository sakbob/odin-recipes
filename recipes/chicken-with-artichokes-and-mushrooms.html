        <ul>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) can marinated quartered artichoke hearts, drained, liquid reserved</li>
            <li>1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
            <li>1 cup white wine</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon capers</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Season chicken with salt and pepper. Heat oil and
                butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Brown
                chicken in oil and butter for 5 to 7 minutes per
                side; remove from skillet, and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place artichoke hearts and mushrooms in the skillet,
                and saute until mushrooms are brown and tender.
                Return chicken to skillet, and pour in reserved
                artichoke liquid and wine. Reduce heat to low, and
                simmer for about 10 to 15 minutes, until chicken is
                no longer pink and juices run clear.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir in capers, and simmer for another 5 minutes.
                Remove from heat; serve immediately.
            </li>
        </ol>
