            <li>3/4 fresh pineapple - peeled, cored, and cut into chunks</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
            <li>1/2 cup pineapple juice, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1/3 cup packed brown sugar, or to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons cider vinegar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook
                and stir sausage, onion, and green bell pepper
                until vegetables start to become tender, about 8
                minutes; add pineapple and cook, stirring occasionally,
                until the pineapple is hot, about 5 minutes more.
            </li>
            <li>
                Beat pineapple juice and cornstarch together in a bowl
                using a whisk. Stir brown sugar, cider vinegar, soy
                sauce, and minced garlic with the pineapple juice until
                the sugar dissolves into the liquid; pour over the
                sausage mixture and cook until the sauce thickens, 5 to
                8 minutes.
