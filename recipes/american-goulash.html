        <p>
            This recipe is an American spin on goulash.
            It was invented to stretch a small amount of beef into
            enough food for a not-so-small family.
            It was made by Chef John Mitzewich who calls it one of
            his all-time comfort food meals when growing up.

        </ul>

            <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
            <li>
                Heat oil in a pot over medium-high heat.
                Add ground beef and onion; cook and stir
                until beef is browned and crumbly and onion
                is translucent, about 5 minutes. Continue
                to cook and stir until liquid is evaporated,
                3 to 5 minutes. Add garlic, bay leaves,
                paprika, Italian seasoning, salt, black pepper,
                and cayenne.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cook, stirring occasionally, until flavors
                come together, about 3 minutes. Pour in
                broth, marinara sauce, and diced tomatoes.
                Pour water into the sauce jar, swirl, and
                pour into the pot. Sit in soy sauce; bring
                to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium and
                simmer until flavors intensify, about
                30 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Increase the heat to medium-high and bring to a
                rapid simmer. Stir in macaroni; cook, stirring
                occasionally, until just barely tender, about 12
                minutes. Check for doneness after 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove the heat and discard bay leaves. Stir in
                Cheddar and parsley. Cover and let rest for 5
                minutes. Taste and season as desired.
